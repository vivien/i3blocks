/*
 * Parse a click, previous read from stdin.
 *
 * A click looks like this ("name" and "instance" can be absent):
 *
 *     ',{"name":"foo","instance":"bar","button":1,"x":1186,"y":13}\n'
 *
 * Note that this function is non-idempotent. We need to parse from right to
 * left. It's ok since the JSON layout is known and fixed.
